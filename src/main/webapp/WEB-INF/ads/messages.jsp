<%--Error messages--%>

<%--Isn't it frustrating when a site won't let you submit a form but won't tell you why? Implement functionality to display error messages to users if they do something wrong, for example, if they try to register but their passwords don't match, or if they try to create a ad without a title.--%>

<%--Consider storing error messages temporarily in the session and having a messages.jsp partial to handle this.--%>
